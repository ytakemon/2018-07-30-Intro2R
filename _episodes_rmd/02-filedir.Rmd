## Working Directories
The part of the operating system responsible for managing files and directories is called the file system. It organizes our data into files, which hold information, and directories (also called “folders”), which hold files or other directories.

Several commands are frequently used to create, inspect, rename, and delete files and directories. To start exploring them, we’ll go to our open shell window.

First let’s find out where we are by running a command called `getwd()` (which stands for “get working directory”). Directories are like places - at any time while we are using the shell we are in exactly one place, called our current working directory. Commands mostly read and write files in the current working directory, i.e. “here”, so knowing where you are before running a command is important. `getwd()` shows you where you are:


```{r, results ="hide"}
getwd()
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
"/Users/nelle"
```
Here, the computer's response is `/Users/nelle`, which is Nelle's **home directory**.

> ## Home Directory Variation
>
> The home directory path will look different on different operating systems. On Linux it may look like `/home/nelle`, and on Windows it will be similar to `C:\Documents and Settings\nelle` or `C:\Users\nelle`.
> (Note that it may look slightly different for different versions of Windows.) In future examples, we’ve used Mac output as the default - Linux and Windows output may differ slightly, but should be generally similar.
>
{: .callout}

To understand what a “home directory” is, let’s have a look at how the file system as a whole is organized. For the sake of this example, we’ll be illustrating the filesystem on our scientist Nelle’s computer. After this illustration, you’ll be learning commands to explore your own filesystem, which will be constructed in a similar way, but not be exactly identical.

On Nelle’s computer, the filesystem looks like this:

![](../fig/rmd-02-filesystem.svg)

At the top is the root directory that holds everything else. We refer to it using a slash character, `/`, on its own; this is the leading slash in `/Users/nelle`.

Inside that directory are several other directories: `bin` (which is where some built-in programs are stored), `data` (for miscellaneous data files), Users (where users’ personal directories are located), `tmp` (for temporary files that don’t need to be stored long-term), and so on.

We know that our current working directory `/Users/nelle` is stored inside `/Users` because `/Users` is the first part of its name. Similarly, we know that `/Users` is stored inside the root directory `/` because its name begins with `/`.

> ## Slashes
>
> Notice that there are two meanings for the `/` character. When it appears at the front of a file or directory name, it refers to the root directory. When it appears inside a name, it’s just a separator.
>
{: .callout}

Underneath `/Users`, we find one directory for each user with an account on Nelle’s machine, her colleagues the Mummy and Wolfman.
![](../fig/rmd-02-home-directories.svg)

The Mummy’s files are stored in `/Users/imhotep`, Wolfman’s in `/Users/larry`, and Nelle’s in `/Users/nelle`. Because Nelle is the user in our examples here, this is why we get /Users/nelle as our home directory.
Typically, when you open a new command prompt you will be in your home directory to start.

Now let’s learn the command that will let us see the contents of our own filesystem. We can see what’s in our home directory by running `list.files()`:

```{r warning=FALSE,results="hide"}
list.files()
```
```{r echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
setwd("~/")
list.files()
```
`list.files()` prints the names of the files and directories in the current directory. 
(Again, your results may be slightly different depending on your operating system and how you have customized your filesystem.)


```{r warning=FALSE,results="hide"}
list.files("Desktop/ExampleDir")
```
```{r echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
setwd("~/")
list.files("Desktop/ExampleDir")
```
`list.files(path)` prints the names of the files and directories at the given path. 


## Navigating directories

Let’s say we want to move to the Desktop directory. We can use the following commands to get there:
```{r warning=FALSE,results="hide",error=TRUE,message=FALSE}
setwd("~/Desktop")
list.files()
```
```{r echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
setwd("~/")
list.files("Desktop/ExampleDir")
```
`setwd(path)` means 'Set working directory' and the path defines where there directory will be set. In this case the Desktop directory. With `list.files` and `getwd()` we can see now that the directory has changed.

## Absolute paths vs relative paths

There are two ways you can define paths to a file or a directory **absolute paths** and **relative paths**. So far wer have been using **relative paths**, when we used `list.files` or `setwd()`









## Introduction

The scientific process is naturally incremental, and many projects
start life as random notes, some code, then a manuscript, and
eventually everything is a bit mixed together.

Most people tend to organize their projects like this:

![](../fig/bad_layout.png)

There are many reasons why we should *ALWAYS* avoid this:

1. It is really hard to tell which version of your data is
the original and which is the modified;
2. It gets really messy because it mixes files with various
extensions together;
3. It probably takes you a lot of time to actually find
things, and relate the correct figures to the exact code
that has been used to generate it;

A good project layout will ultimately make your life easier:

* It will help ensure the integrity of your data;
* It makes it simpler to share your code with someone else
(a lab-mate, collaborator, or supervisor);
* It allows you to easily upload your code with your manuscript submission;
* It makes it easier to pick the project back up after a break.

## A possible solution

Fortunately, there are tools and packages which can help you manage your work effectively.

One of the most powerful and useful aspects of RStudio is its project management
functionality. We'll be using this today to create a self-contained, reproducible
project.


> ## Challenge: Creating a self-contained project
>
> We're going to create a new project in RStudio:
>
> 1. Click the "File" menu button, then "New Project".
> 2. Click "New Directory".
> 3. Click "Empty Project".
> 4. Type in the name of the directory to store your project, e.g. "my_project".
> 5. Make sure that the checkbox for "Create a git repository" is selected.
> 6. Click the "Create Project" button.
{: .challenge}

Now when we start R in this project directory, or open this project with RStudio,
all of our work on this project will be entirely self-contained in this directory.

## Best practices for project organization

Although there is no "best" way to lay out a project, there are some general
principles to adhere to that will make project management easier:

### Treat data as read only

This is probably the most important goal of setting up a project. Data is
typically time consuming and/or expensive to collect. Working with them
interactively (e.g., in Excel) where they can be modified means you are never
sure of where the data came from, or how it has been modified since collection.
It is therefore a good idea to treat your data as "read-only".

### Data Cleaning

In many cases your data will be "dirty": it will need significant preprocessing
to get into a format R (or any other programming language) will find useful. This
task is sometimes called "data munging". I find it useful to store these scripts
in a separate folder, and create a second "read-only" data folder to hold the
"cleaned" data sets.

### Treat generated output as disposable

Anything generated by your scripts should be treated as disposable: it should
all be able to be regenerated from your scripts.

There are lots of different ways to manage this output. I find it useful to
have an output folder with different sub-directories for each separate
analysis. This makes it easier later, as many of my analyses are exploratory
and don't end up being used in the final project, and some of the analyses
get shared between projects.

> ## Tip: Good Enough Practices for Scientific Computing
>
> [Good Enough Practices for Scientific Computing](https://github.com/swcarpentry/good-enough-practices-in-scientific-computing/blob/gh-pages/good-enough-practices-for-scientific-computing.pdf) gives the following recommendations for project organization:
>
> 1. Put each project in its own directory, which is named after the project.
> 2. Put raw data and metadata in the `data` directory, and files generated during cleanup and analysis in a `results` directory.
> 3. Put source for the project's scripts and programs in the `scripts` directory, and programs brought in from elsewhere or compiled locally in the `bin` directory.
> 4. Put generated reports (such as Knitr reports, which will be discussed later) in the `reports` directory.
> 5. Name all files to reflect their content or function.

> ## Tip: ProjectTemplate - a possible solution
>
> One way to automate the management of projects is to install the third-party package, `ProjectTemplate`.
> This package will set up an ideal directory structure for project management.
> This is very useful as it enables you to have your analysis pipeline/workflow organised and structured.
> Together with the default RStudio project functionality and Git you will be able to keep track of your
> work as well as be able to share your work with collaborators.
>
> 1. Install `ProjectTemplate`.
> 2. Load the library
> 3. Initialise the project:
>
> ```{r, eval=FALSE}
> install.packages("ProjectTemplate")
> library(ProjectTemplate)
> create.project("../my_project", merge.strategy = "allow.non.conflict")
> ```
>

### Separate function definition and application

The most effective way I find to work in R, is to play around in the interactive
session, then copy commands across to a script file when I'm sure they work and
do what I want. You can also save all the commands you've entered using the
`history` command, but I don't find it useful because when I'm typing its 90%
trial and error.

When your project is new and shiny, the script file usually contains many lines
of directly executed code. As it matures, reusable chunks get pulled into their
own functions. It's a good idea to separate these into separate folders; one
to store useful functions that you'll reuse across analyses and projects, and
one to store the analysis scripts.

> ## Tip: avoiding duplication
>
> You may find yourself using data or analysis scripts across several projects.
> Typically you want to avoid duplication to save space and avoid having to
> make updates to code in multiple places.
>
> In this case I find it useful to make "symbolic links", which are essentially
> shortcuts to files somewhere else on a filesystem. On Linux and OS X you can
> use the `ln -s` command, and on Windows you can either create a shortcut or
> use the `mklink` command from the windows terminal.

### Save the data in the data directory

Now we have a good directory structure we will now place/save the data file in the `data/` directory.

> ## Challenge 1
> Download the gapminder data from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/resbaz/r-novice-gapminder-files/master/data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv).
>
> 1. Download the file (CTRL + S, right mouse click -> "Save as", or File -> "Save page as")
> 2. Make sure it's saved under the name `gapminder-FiveYearData.csv`
> 3. Save the file in the `data/` folder within your project.
>
> We will load and inspect these data later.
{: .challenge}

> ## Challenge 2
> It is useful to get some general idea about the dataset, directly from the
> command line, before loading it into R. Understanding the dataset better
> will come handy when making decisions on how to load it in R. Use command-line
> shell to answer the following questions:
> 1. What is the size of the file?
> 2. How many rows of data does it contain?
> 3. What are the data types of values stored in this file
>
> > ## Solution to Challenge 2
> >
> > By running these commands in the shell:
> > ```{r ch2a-sol, engine='sh'}
> > ls -lh data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv
> > ```
> > The file size is 80K.
> > ```{r ch2b-sol, engine='sh'}
> > wc -l data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv
> > ```
> > There are 1705 lines and the data looks like:
> > ```{r ch2c-sol, engine='sh'}
> > head data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv
> > ```

{: .challenge}

> ## Tip: command line in R Studio
>
> You can quickly open up a shell in RStudio using the **Tools -> Shell...** menu item.

### Version Control

We also set up our project to integrate with git, putting it under version control.
RStudio has a nicer interface to git than shell, but is very limited in what it can
do, so you will find yourself occasionally needing to use the shell. Let's go
through and make an initial commit of our template files.

The workspace/history pane has a tab for "Git". We can stage each file by checking the box:
you will see a green "A" next to stage files and folders, and yellow question marks next to
files or folders git doesn't know about yet. RStudio also nicely shows you the difference
between files from different commits.
